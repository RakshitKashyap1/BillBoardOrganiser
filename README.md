# 🏙️ BBO - The "Where Did I Put That Giant Sign?" Manager

![BBO Banner](./bbo_banner_1772393168934.png)

**The Ultimate Bridge Between Brands and Billboards. No safety harness required.**

 BBO is a high-performance, role-based platform designed to revolutionise the billboard advertising industry. Built with a striking **Neo-Brutalist aesthetic**, it's the only app that looks as bold as a 40-foot sign on the highway. We help advertisers, asset owners, and administrators manage high-visibility spaces without the high-visibility headaches.

## ⚡ Why BBO. is Cooler Than a Times Square Jumbotron

- **🎨 Neo-Brutalist UI**: We hate rounded corners. Every button has a shadow so thick you could trip over it.
- **🔐 Role-Based Access (RBAC)**: Customised dashboards so Advertisers don't accidentally try to sell their own billboards.
- **💸 Startup-Grade Pricing Engine**: Dynamic multipliers! Mumbai premiums! Seasonal surges! It's like Uber, but for static 2D objects.
- **🚀 Scalable Architecture**: A backend so organized it probably color-codes its socks.
- **📊 Real-time Analytics**: See how many people are looking at your ad instead of the road (Disclaimer: BBO. is not responsible for traffic accidents).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack: The Engine Room

We leverage modern technologies to ensure speed, security, and the ability to handle millions of impressions.

- **Backend**: Django & DRF (The brains/muscle)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite ⚡ (The pretty face)
- **API**: Centralized v1 Versioning 🗺️ (The future-proofing)
- **Design**: Custom Neo-Brutalist CSS System 🎨 (The attitude)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Where the giant sign data sleeps)
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose 🐳
- **Web Server**: Nginx (Frontend) + Gunicorn (Backend)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions 🔄

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (One-Click Setup)

We've automated the boring stuff. If you're on **Windows**, run the PowerShell script. If you're on **macOS/Linux**, use the bash script.

### For Windows Users (PowerShell)
```powershell
./setup.ps1
```

### For Unix/Linux/macOS Users (Bash)
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## 🌩️ Cloud Database Setup (Supabase)

If you're moving beyond `localhost` and want to use a hosted database like **Supabase**, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Project
- Sign up at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
- Create a new project.
- Navigate to **Project Settings > Database**.

### 2. Get Connection Details
You'll need the following info from your Supabase dashboard:
- **Host**: `db.xxxx.supabase.co` (or use the Connection Pooling host for high-volume apps).
- **Port**: `6543` (usually for Transaction pooling).
- **Database Name**: `postgres` (default).
- **User**: `postgres.xxxxxxx` (your unique project ID).
- **Password**: The password you set during project creation.

### 3. Update your `.env`
In your `backend/.env` file, update the following fields:
```env
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_HOST=aws-0-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.pooler.supabase.com
DB_PORT=6543
```
*Alternatively, you can provide a single `DB_URL` string if you prefer:*
```env
DB_URL=postgresql://postgres.xxxx:your_pass@db.xxxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### 4. Apply Migrations & Seed
Once connected, run:
```bash
# Apply schema
python manage.py migrate

# Seed with Indian billboard data (Optional, but recommended)
python manage.py shell -c "import seed_db; seed_db.seed_data()"
# OR simply
python seed_db.py
```

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

To keep the "Organiser" in BBO. organized and *secure*:

1. **Never commit `.env` files**: Our `.gitignore` is pre-configured to skip these. If you accidentally commit one, rotate your secrets immediately!
2. **Environment Templates**: Always update `.env.example` if you add new variables so other devs know what to configure.
3. **Database Secrets**: Use a strong password for your Supabase instance. Avoid using default passwords like `admin123`.
4. **JWT Security**: The `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is currently set to a default for local development. For production, generate a long, random string.

## 🛠️ Manual Setup

If you prefer to do things by hand (we respect that), follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Python 3.10+](https://python.org) installed.

### 1. Clone the Beast
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RakshitKashyap1/BillBoardOrganiser.git
cd BillBoardOrganiser
```

### 2. Frontend Power-Up
```bash
# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Install and run
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Backend Brain-Transfer
```bash
cd backend

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1 # Or 'source venv/bin/activate' on Mac/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations and start server
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Quick Start

Get the entire stack running in seconds with Docker.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running

### Start All Services
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Access the App
- **Frontend**: http://localhost
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/

### Useful Commands
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker compose logs -f backend

# Stop all services
docker compose down

# Rebuild after code changes
docker compose up --build -d

# Run migrations manually
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate

# Seed the database
docker compose exec backend python seed_db.py
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and building.

### Frontend Pipeline (`.github/workflows/frontend-ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push or PR to `main` on frontend file changes
- **Jobs**: Node.js setup → Install → Build → Docker image build
- **Caching**: npm dependencies and Docker layers via GitHub Actions cache

### Backend Pipeline (`.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Push or PR to `main` on backend file changes
- **Jobs**: Python setup → Install → Flake8 lint → PostgreSQL test → Migrations → Docker image build
- **Services**: Spins up PostgreSQL 16 for integration testing

### Adding New Environment Variables
If you add new variables, update:
1. The relevant `.env.example` file
2. `docker-compose.yml` environment section
3. CI workflow secrets if needed (GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions)

## 🧪 Advanced Pricing Engine: The "Secret Sauce"

Our `pricing_engine.py` isn't a basic calculator. It's an AdTech masterpiece:

- **Mumbai Premium**: +50% cost (Because naturally, Mumbai).
- **Seasonal Surge**: +30% in Nov/Dec (Ho ho ho, pay up).
- **Bulk Discount**: -10% if you're booking for more than 30 days.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy: Neo-Brutalism

BBO. isn't just another corporate dashboard with soft shadows and pastel colors. We embrace the **Neo-Brutalism** trend:

- **Hard Truths, Hard Shadows**: Solid black offsets only.
- **Thick Outlines**: 3px borders because we're not afraid of commitment.
- **Vibrant Chaos**: Indigo, Pink, and Yellow. Your eyes won't be bored.

_Built with passion and too much coffee for the future of Out-Of-Home advertising._ 🌃
